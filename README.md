**Run autonomous AI agents safely — at scale, in CI, on Kubernetes.**

## Why Axon?

AI coding agents like Claude Code are most powerful when they run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — no human in the loop, fully autonomous. But on your laptop, that flag lives up to its name: the agent can touch your filesystem, network, and everything else on the host. And there's no easy way to fan out dozens of agents across repos, or plug them into a CI pipeline.

**Kubernetes solves both problems at once.** Inside a Pod, "dangerously skip permissions" isn't dangerous anymore — the agent gets full autonomy *within* an isolated, ephemeral container while the blast radius stays at zero for the host. And because it's Kubernetes, you get parallelism, scheduling, and CI integration for free.

Axon is the controller that ties it together. Define what you want the agent to do, and Axon runs it as an isolated Job with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` enabled by default.

- **Safe autonomy** — agents run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` inside isolated, ephemeral Pods. Full speed, zero risk to the host.
- **Scale out** — launch hundreds of agents in parallel across repositories. Kubernetes handles scheduling and resource management.
- **CI-native** — trigger agents from any pipeline. A Task is just a Kubernetes resource — create it with `kubectl`, Helm, Argo, or your own tooling.
- **Observable** — watch agents move through `Pending → Running → Succeeded/Failed` with kubectl.
- **Simple** — one CRD, one controller, zero dependencies beyond a running cluster.

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T1["Task: refactor auth"] --> AC[Axon Controller]
    T2["Task: add tests"] --> AC
    T3["Task: update docs"] --> AC

    AC --> J1[Job 1] --> P1["Pod 1 (--dangerously-skip-permissions)"] --> S1[Succeeded]
    AC --> J2[Job 2] --> P2["Pod 2 (--dangerously-skip-permissions)"] --> S2[Succeeded]
    AC --> J3[Job 3] --> P3["Pod 3 (--dangerously-skip-permissions)"] --> F3[Failed]
```

1. You **apply a Task** manifest with a prompt, agent type, credential reference, and optionally a git repo to clone.
2. The **Axon controller** creates a Kubernetes **Job**.
3. If a workspace is specified, an **init container clones the repo**. Then the agent Pod starts with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
4. The agent runs **fully autonomous** inside the container — no permission prompts, no risk to the host.
5. Axon **tracks status** (phase, pod name, timestamps, messages). Delete the Task and the Job + Pod are automatically cleaned up via owner references.

Currently supported agents: **Claude Code** (`claude-code`).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (1.28+)
- kubectl configured

### Install

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjkim42/axon/main/install-crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gjkim42/axon/main/install.yaml
```

### Run Your First Task

1. Create a Secret with your Anthropic API key:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic anthropic-api-key \
  --from-literal=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

2. Run a task:

```bash
axon run -p "Create a hello world program in Python" --secret anthropic-api-key -w
```

3. Watch it go:

```
NAME              TYPE          PHASE      AGE
task-a1b2c        claude-code   Pending    0s
task-a1b2c        claude-code   Running    3s
task-a1b2c        claude-code   Succeeded  42s
```

Run against a git repo:

```bash
axon run -p "Add unit tests" --secret anthropic-api-key \
  --workspace-repo https://github.com/your-org/repo.git --workspace-ref main -w
```

<details>
<summary>Using kubectl and YAML instead of the CLI</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: axon.io/v1alpha1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  type: claude-code
  prompt: "Create a hello world program in Python"
  credentials:
    type: api-key
    secretRef:
      name: anthropic-api-key
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f task.yaml
kubectl get tasks -w
```

Add `spec.workspace` to clone a repo before the agent starts:

```yaml
  workspace:
    repo: https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
    ref: main
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using OAuth instead of an API key</summary>

```bash
kubectl create secret generic claude-oauth \
  --from-literal=CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<your-oauth-token>
```

Then pass `--credential-type oauth --secret claude-oauth` to `axon run`, or set `spec.credentials.type: oauth` in YAML.

## Use Cases

- **Hands-free CI** — let an autonomous agent generate, refactor, or fix code as a pipeline step, with no permission prompts blocking the run.
- **Batch refactoring at scale** — spin up dozens of agents in parallel to apply the same prompt across microservices, each safely isolated in its own Pod.
- **Scheduled maintenance** — pair with a CronJob or workflow engine to run recurring code-health agents on a schedule.
- **Developer self-service** — expose agent execution through an internal portal so any developer can run a fully autonomous AI agent without local setup.
- **AI in your internal platform** — embed Axon as the execution layer for AI-powered features in your developer platform.

## Development

Build, test, and iterate with `make`:

```bash
make update             # generate code, CRDs, fmt, tidy
make verify             # generate + vet + tidy-diff check
make test               # unit tests
make test-integration   # integration tests (envtest)
make test-e2e           # e2e tests (requires cluster)
make build              # build binary
make image              # build docker image
```

## Roadmap

- **Task dependencies** — chain tasks so one waits for another to finish before starting, enabling agent pipelines in pure Kubernetes.
